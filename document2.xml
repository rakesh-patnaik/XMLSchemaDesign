    <subject>iPhone X iOS 13 Dark Mode Bug</subject>
    <question>
        Hi,
            I have an issue with my iPhone X after iOS 13 update. 
            I started to use dark mode because I like it, but when brightness is not set on 100% 
            I see some annoying flickering during scrolling where Dark Grey and Black content are overlapped e.g. settings app
    </question>

                Iâ€™ve had this same issue on my iPhone XS where the blacks have a sort of motion blur effect 
                where when you scroll it overlaps on other colors, this does not affect older models without 
                an oled such as the 7+ which I tested on and it did not  have this bug on that LCD.

                        Exactly, I think it is a software bug
