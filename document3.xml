    <subject>Anyone having issues with their watch locking while on their wrist.</subject>
    <question>
        Is anyone else having an issue with their watch constantly locking for no reason. 
        I haven't changed the tightness and never had a problem prior to the new update. 
        Its very annoying.
    </question>

                Hello Faunsnyder and welcome to Apple Support Communities. 
                It seems like you are having some issues with the Apple Watch locking while you are wearing it. 
                I'll be happy to help look into this with you. When you say "locking" do you mean that you have to enter the passcode? 
                If you open the Watch app on the paired iPhone and scroll to Passcode and tap that, is Wrist Detection enabled?
